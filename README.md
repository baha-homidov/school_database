#Simple project to practice C++

Despcription:
This is a simple student data management system written in C++. The main reason of writing this programm was to practice C++. So far there are several main 
features: 
1.Storing student data:  
  a) Full name  
  b) Major name  
  c) Birth date(as a 'Date' data type)  
  d) Enrollment date(as a 'Date' data type)  
  e) Marks(so far only 4 subjects)  
2.Saving data as a file and ability to load saved data from the file.  
3.Handling invalid input from the user(but not perfect).  
4.Adding entries.  
5.Deleting entries.  
6.Searching via full name or ID number.  
7.Showing average score of a given student or the whole school.  
8.Sorting student-list by name or ID number(entries are sorted by ID numbers by default).
