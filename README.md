# Simple project to practice C++

## Description:
<p>This is a simple student data management system written in C++. The main reason of writing this programm was to practice C++. So far there are several main features: </p> 
   
* Storing 'Student' data:  
    - Full name  
    - Major name  
    - Birth date(as a 'Date' data type)  
    - Enrollment date(as a 'Date' data type)  
    - Marks(According to a School's subject list)
* Storing separate school datas:  
    - 'School' can have its own subject list  
    - 'School' can have its own name  
    - 'School' has it's own student list  
    - 'School' data is protected with password  
* Saving data as a file and ability to load saved data from the file.  
* Handling invalid input from the user(but not perfect).  
* Adding entries.  
* Deleting entries.  
* Searching via full name or ID number.  
* Showing average score of a given student or the whole school.  
* Sorting student-list by name or ID number(entries are sorted by ID numbers by default).
